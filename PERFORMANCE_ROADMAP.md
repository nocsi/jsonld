# JsonldEx Performance Optimization Roadmap for Claudeville

## Overview
In a multi-agent AI environment ("Claudeville"), JSON-LD processing becomes **CPU-bound** rather than I/O-bound. Traditional network bottlenecks disappear, making aggressive performance optimizations essential rather than optional.

## Priority Optimization Levels

### ðŸŸ¢ **Level 1: SIMD Core (Essential)**
```rust
[dependencies]
simd-json = "0.13"      # 3x faster JSON parsing
mimalloc = "0.1"        # Better memory allocator
memchr = "2.7"          # SIMD string operations
aho-corasick = "1.1"    # Fast multi-pattern matching
```

**Impact:** 2-3x performance improvement  
**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Priority:** Critical for multi-agent environments

### ðŸŸ¡ **Level 2: Memory Optimization (Important)**
```rust
bumpalo = "3.14"        # Arena allocation
parking_lot = "0.12"    # Faster mutexes
crossbeam = "0.8"       # Lock-free data structures
dashmap = "5.5"         # Concurrent hashmap
```

**Impact:** Reduced memory pressure, better concurrent performance  
**Effort:** 4-8 hours  
**Priority:** High for 100+ concurrent agents

### ðŸ”´ **Level 3: GPU Acceleration (Advanced)**
```rust
wgpu = "0.18"           # GPU compute shaders
candle-core = "0.15"    # Tensor operations for batch processing
tokio = "1.35"          # Async runtime
```

**Impact:** Massive speedup for batch operations (1000+ documents)  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Priority:** Medium (high-impact but complex)

## Claudeville-Specific Features

### **Batch Context Processing**
```rust
pub fn batch_expand_contexts(contexts: Vec<JsonValue>) -> Result<Vec<JsonValue>> {
    // GPU shader processes 1000+ contexts simultaneously
    // Much faster than sequential CPU processing
}
```

### **Zero-Copy Agent Communication**
```rust
pub fn share_context_cache(cache_key: &str) -> SharedContext {
    // Lock-free shared memory for context reuse between agents
}
```

### **Streaming Document Processing**
```rust
pub fn stream_process_documents(docs: DocumentStream) -> ResultStream {
    // Incremental processing for massive document sets
    // Prevents memory overflow with large batches
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with SIMD JSON parsing** - biggest bang for buck
2. **Add memory optimizations** - essential for multi-agent concurrency  
3. **Implement GPU batch processing** - for large-scale document operations
4. **Add streaming support** - handle massive document collections

## Why This Matters for Claudeville

- **100+ agents** processing simultaneously
- **No network I/O** - pure compute-bound workloads
- **Shared context caches** - memory efficiency critical
- **Massive document batches** - GPU parallelism becomes valuable
- **Agent-to-agent communication** - zero-copy optimization needed

*The performance optimizations that seem like "overkill" for typical web applications become **table stakes** in a multi-agent AI environment.*
